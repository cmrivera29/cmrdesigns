            What is a Website?

    <p>A website is a container that holds ideas, reflections, and information.</p>



    <p>It's a virtual space that lives on a server and can be accessed by anyone.</p>

    <p>A website can be used for businesses and organizations to sell products, for individuals to connect with others, to build a brand, to establish a presence, to broadcast information, or to entertain. </p>


<h2>Room</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, a website can be used as a room that is bound by four walls. It can also have rooms that lead to other rooms.</p>

<h2>Plant</h2>

    <p>The web designer takes their time to plant a seed and watch it grow.</p>

    <p>Web designers can take their time crafting and designing their websites from scratch. Each visual element is given careful attention and added by hand. Even the negative space on the website is given thought.</p>
    

 



<h2>Puddles</h2>

<div style="padding-top:20%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://gifer.com/embed/KTe5" width="55%" height="25%" style='position:absolute;top:10px;left:300px;' frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gifer.com"></a></p>

    <p>Like the rain, the future of technology is also challenging to predict with certainty, but it's unlikely that websites will become obsolete anytime soon. Websites are also like puddles that can hold information temporarily. As new technologies and platforms emerge, websites have become an integral part of our daily lives as they are used for various reasons.</p>





    


<h2>Shelf</h2>

<div style="padding-top:30%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://gifer.com/embed/7mTq" width="55%" height="25%" style='position:absolute;top:1px;left:300px;' frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://gifer.com"></a></p>

    <p>At times a website can act as a shelf that holds several elements and ideas in a single place. Those elements can get replaced like books on a shelf after a while.</p>








<h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>Most of the things I use on a daily are because of technology. The obvious things are my phone, computer, monitor, and digital screens. However, some things do not need to be digital or electrical to be considered technology. My desk, the chair, and even the stapler on my desk can be regarded as technology. I didn't make any of these things, and they don't grow on trees or from under the ground, so they are technologically advanced to me. I often take these things for granted and don't consider them as technology. I enjoy using them and am very grateful to have them.</p>

        <p>A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it.</p>
