            <p>AH, that irritating bing-bong sound at the beginning of the article is not a great warm sound. Instead, it reminded me of all the times I had to sit at my computer desk and wait. If anything, it taught me about having patience and not smashing my PC with a bat. I had to continuously unplug the wire and plug it back in to ensure it worked. It's true to look back at this time and laugh and just be amazed by how far we've come. </p>

                    <h2>Frank Chimero's article "The Web's Grain" is about the nature of the web as a medium and how it shapes how we interact with it. Chimero argues that the web has its own unique "grain" or texture, which is determined by its underlying technologies and the way that information is organized and presented. </h2>

        <h2>It's true that sometimes we start out in awe of something or someone, but as we get to know them better or experience more of it, our initial admiration may transform into a more critical perspective, leading to disappointment or disillusionment. It's like meeting your hero and being dissatisfied with that meeting. I think that's a natural human tendency to want to organize and make sense of our experiences, even if that means grappling with negative emotions like disappointment.</h2>

        <h2>Chimero suggests that designers and developers need to understand this grain to create effective and engaging web experiences that take advantage of the web's unique qualities. Designers can't consume everything in one shot; instead, they take small focal ranges to create a complete whole that works. Additionally, Chimero discusses the importance of embracing the web's inherent nature rather than trying to mimic the design and layout of other media, such as print or television. Overall, the article encourages web creators to think deeply about the nature of the web as a medium and to design with its unique qualities in mind.</h2>
