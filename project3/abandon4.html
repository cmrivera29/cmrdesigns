<p>Oedipus' travels eventually took him to Thebes.<br>
    <br>
    At the time Thebes was being plagued by a bloodthirsty Sphinx. <br>
    <br>
    This Sphinx had been killing the people of Thebes randomly and spouting violent riddles of death. <br>
    <br>
    If you could not answer the riddle correctly, you would be devoured by the Sphinx.</p>

        <h3>When Oedipus did face the Sphinx, he was given a puzzle:<br>
            <br>
 
            The Sphinx asked, "What walks on four feet in the morning, two in the afternoon and three at night?"<br>
             <br>
            And Oedipus answered: <br><i> "Man: as an infant, he crawls on all fours; as an adult, he walks on two legs and; in old age, he uses a walking stick"</i> <br>
             <br>
            Oedipus was correct! <br>
            And so the Sphinx killed herself.<br>
            <br> 
            Oedipus shows sympathy for the mourning Queen, who lost her husband. Oedipus' success in ridding Thebes of the monster had given him the right to marry Jocasta as a Theban prize.<br> And so, part two of the prophecy was complete. Oedipus had just married his biological mother.
