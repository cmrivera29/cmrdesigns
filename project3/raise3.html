        <h3>Laius orders Oedipus to travel to Delphi, where a famous Oracle lives. <br>
            <br>
            There, the Oracle tells him that the only way to destroy the Sphinx is to dethrone the king by killing him, and only then will he have the power to solve the Sphinx's riddle and save his people, his mother, and himself. </h3>

                Oedipus travels back to Thebes. When his father asked him about the Oracle, he whispers in his ear: <i>The Oracle told me to kill you!</i> <br>
                <br>
                As his father widens his eyes, Oedipus stabs him in the heart and instantly kills him. </p>
