                After Oedipus had married his mother and had children with her, it was a long time until the truth about the prophecy was revealed to them.<br>
<br>
At some point, Jocasta, the wife (and mother) of Oedipus Rex, tells him about the prophecy. She hopes that these words will comfort Oedipus, but in fact, they have the opposite effect. Oedipus slowly comes to realize the truth.<br>
<br>
Jocasta could no longer live with this truth, and so she took her own life.  <br>
<br>
<i> Oedipus also couldn't live with the truth and gouged his eyes out.</i>
