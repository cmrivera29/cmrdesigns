                    <li>These are two traditional ways to prepare plantains. Tostones are made from green plantain, which is savory. The plantain is cut into thick wheels marinated in water and garlic, then deep-fried in oil to soften, smashed, and deep-fried again until crispy. Amarillos, on the other hand, are ripe plantains cut into pieces and fried until the outside is almost blackened, and the inside is soft and sweet.</li>

                        <h4> Castillo San Felipe del Morro </h4> 
                    
                        <p>A representative landmark of Puerto Rico’s colonial legacy, the Castillo San Felipe del Morro, or El Morro for short, is an impressive citadel that sits at the very top of Old San Juan. Its construction began in 1539 and concluded around 1790; during those 250 years, the castle became a six-level fortress designed to protect the island from attackers approaching by sea. The bastion – integrated by barracks, dungeons, and storerooms – still holds some of the original cannons facing the ocean. This fortress has seen many battles over the centuries, from Sir Francis Drake’s attack in 1595 to the 1898 Bombardment of San Juan by the US Navy, but it has never been defeated. In 1898, as a result of the Spanish-American War, the island changed hands from Spain to the United States. The castle houses the oldest lighthouse on the island, built under Spanish rule in 1846. El Morro was later designated as part of Fort Brooke and actively used as a military installation during the First and Second World Wars. In 1961, the US Army retired El Morro, passing it on to the National Park Service to establish a museum.</p>

                        <p>Since opening in 2021, Distrito T-Mobile has become a favorite destination for both locals and visitors. This five-acre entertainment venue at the heart of the Convention Center District in San Juan has something for everybody to enjoy, whether you’re looking for a chill daytime hang out or an exciting night out. Distrito T-Mobile’s 10 restaurants and bars range from high-end Puerto Rican cuisine at La Central by Mario Pagán to Spanish tapas at Barullo Taberna Española to bar bites and beers at Arena Medalla. Walk around the space and take in beautiful works of art by local artists and be wowed by the giant screens that bring the main plaza to life. Stick around to catch a movie at Caribbean Cinemas VIP (which has the first ScreenX Theater in the Caribbean), enjoy a concert at Coca-Cola Music Hall, or ride the zipline at Toro Verde Urban Park.</p>

                        <p>Spanning 500 years of history, Old San Juan is, without a doubt, one of the most iconic and treasured places in Puerto Rico. Wander the cobblestone streets to soak up the unique architecture and colorful streets. You’ll find fun local shops and lively restaurants and bars scattered throughout the old city.

                            Free golf carts called Garita Carts can take you around the most important landmarks such as El Morro, Castillo San Cristóbal, Cuartel de Ballajá, and La Fortaleza, among others. You can also take guided tours to learn more about the history of the many 500-year-old buildings, local cuisine, and even visit the place where one of the most popular drinks was born, the world-famous piña colada.</p>

                        <h4> Santurce </h4>
                        <p>
                            The Santurce neighborhood, home to the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico and Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, among many other galleries and local shops, is located very close to the Condado district, and about 20 minutes from Old San Juan. The area has become an arts and culture hub with many buildings displaying murals, and galleries showing works by local artists.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Food is also a big deal in Santurce. You can find elegant restaurants alongside little pop-up eateries at gastronomy parks like Lote 23. La Placita de Santurce (Santurce Marketplace), offers tradition, live music, culture, and authentic local food, all in one vibrant stop. Farmers sell their fresh produce during the day, including fruits, vegetables, flowers, and local dishes, and a block party-style celebration takes place on weekend nights.</p>

                        <h4> El Yunque Rainforest </h4>
                        <p>
                            Located on the east side of the Island, El Yunque is the only tropical rainforest that is part of the U.S. National Forest System. Home to more than 240 types of trees, unique birds, native species like the coquí frog, and beautiful scenery, the forest spans 28,000 acres of land that includes 25 waterfalls, several rivers, and ancient petroglyphs of Taíno deities.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Only a one-hour drive from San Juan, you can either navigate El Yunque on your own or take a guided tour to get to the most popular locations. Choose between hiking, ziplining, or horseback riding, and fall in love with the astonishing view from the top of the forest overlooking the region’s lush valleys.</p>

                        <h4> Piñones </h4>
                        <p>
                            Just minutes from San Juan and the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport (SJU), you can find the Afro-Caribbean coastal neighborhood of Piñones. Full of delicious authentic street food, made in the traditional fogón, the many little chinchorros (small dining stands) offer fritters made from plantain, fresh fish, oysters, and a lot sazón. You can also buy cold coconut water to drink straight out of the coconut, or try the crabmeat alcapurrias and bacalaítos (codfish fritters). The weekend is particularly busy if you're looking for a bustling local scene. If you want to relax before you eat, be sure to bring your swimsuit and dive in at a nearby beach—just wait 45 minutes after eating before you swim!

        <h3>Lyrics by Manuel Fernández Juncos (1846-1928)</h3>
    </a>


<p>
La tierra de Borinquén <br>
donde he nacido yo,<br>
es un jardín florido <br>
de mágico fulgor.<br>
<br>
Un cielo siempre nítido<br>
le sirve de dosel<br>
y dan arrullos plácidos<br>
las olas a sus pies.<br>
<br>
Cuando a sus playas llegó Colón;<br>
Exclamó lleno de admiración;<br>
"Oh!, oh!, oh!, esta es la linda<br>
tierra que busco yo".<br>
<br>
Es Borinquén la hija,<br>
la hija del mar y el sol,<br>
del mar y el sol,<br>
del mar y el sol,<br>
del mar y el sol,<br>
del mar y el sol,<br>
<br>
