           <h4>Adam Street Realty LLC</h4> 


              <p>Adam Street Realty LLC is a real estate company that I work for part-time. I was fortunate enough to design the logo for this business and have input on the design. Unfortunately, the design does not correlate with the website, which I want to change. A little about the company: ASR is a real estate business helping families in the Westchester County area find a home since 2008. ASR is based in Yonkers and allows clients to find apartments for rent, buy, or sell. Their agents strive for excellence and can assure top-notch returns for their clients. <br>
                <br>
                Their website is limited on what can be done on it. I would argue that it's not very user-friendly and can be a bit more innovative for the visitor. It has rental listings, information for homebuyers and sellers, and current listings. Users who are looking for a home can use a quick search or map search to find what they are looking for. Visitors can also browse an up-to-date database list of all available properties in a specific area or use the dream home finder form that will conduct a personalized search for the visitor.

       <h4>Visual Hierarchy</h4> 


          <p>Visual hierarchy is the order in which the eye perceives and processes information in the website's design. I would say that the visual elements on this website are not appropriately arranged. The logo and picture of the owner are above the navigation bar. This follows the site as the visitor clicks on the buttons that lead to other pages. The purpose of visual hierarchy is to convey information and meaning effectively, efficiently, and visually appealing. This site fails to do that as the visitors scroll through the page. There is a lack of flow of information that is not engaging to the viewer or memorable.

       <h4>Color</h4> 


          <p>Color is an essential element of design that can evoke emotions, convey meaning, and create visual interest. This site has three strong colors that are repeated throughout the site and are fighting for attention. Dark blue, black, and white are the primary colors for this site. Using different colors throughout the site is good, but these colors are not being used correctly. The overall white background makes the site feel flat, and the dark blue bars do nothing to contribute to the harmony of the site. I suggest combining two colors to create contrast, balance, and harmony. The colors can also be used to highlight important information or elements, like a particular listing or contract offer.

       <h4>Typography</h4> 


          <p>Typography is a crucial aspect of design. When designing a website, typography is vital in creating a visually appealing and easy-to-read interface. Choosing the right font, font size, spacing, and color in typography can significantly impact a website's overall look and feel. Right now, this site uses the default font of Times New Roman. This font can sometimes be good, but it doesn't serve the right purpose on this site. The text looks unprofessional, cluttered, and difficult to read. One important aspect of typography is legibility. The font used should be easy to read, even at small sizes, and should be appropriate for the content and audience. The Times New Roman font is serif, making the text difficult to read on a digital interface. Choosing the suitable typeface for website design is essential, as each font has its own personality and can convey different emotions and meanings. I would suggest something like Arial or Helvetica that has a cleaner look and is easy to read on screens.

       <h4>Consistency</h4> 


          <p>Consistency in website design refers to using the same design elements throughout a website. It helps to establish a visual identity, create a sense of brand recognition, and provide a cohesive user experience. Consistency can be achieved through the use of consistent typography, color schemes, graphic elements, and layout. I feel like this website doesn't have a lot of elements to have visual consistency. An element that I would repeat would be the "D" in the Adam Street Realty logo. By using these consistent design elements, the website can appear more professional and organized, ultimately leading to increased user engagement and satisfaction.

<section id="navigation">
    <div class="navigation1">


       <h4>Navigation</h4> 


          <p>Navigation in website design refers to the menu or links that allow users to move between different pages or sections of a website. It is an important element of website design as it helps users to quickly find the information they are looking for and navigate through the site. Navigation menus are typically located at the top or side of a web page and are often designed in a way consistent across all website pages. This website has a navigation bar slightly below the website header. Something I like about the navigation bar is that it follows the users as they scroll down. So, the header disappears, but the navigation bar follows the user. Good website navigation should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear labels and a logical hierarchy that reflects the site's content. Changing the font and pushing all the buttons to the right side of the page will improve the user experience.

       <h4>Responsiveness</h4> 


          <p>Responsiveness in website design refers to the ability of a website to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. A responsive website design ensures that the layout and content of the website are optimized for the specific device being used to view it, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for the visitor. This site is responsive to phones, tablets, and computers. It also responds well on smaller & bigger screens.

<section id="familiarity">
    <div class="familiarity1">


       <h4>Familiarity</h4> 


          <p>Familiarity in website design refers to the use of design elements and patterns that users are already familiar with and have come to expect when interacting with websites. This familiarity can help users navigate the website more efficiently and understand its purpose and content. For example, using a navigation menu at the top of the page or a search bar in the header are common design patterns that users are familiar with. I feel like this website fulfills that design concept by placing the navigation bar at the top and offering what other real estate companies also offer. I think there should be a balance of familiarity, creativity, and innovation to make the website look a bit more intuitive and different. That way, it won't appear as generic and unmemorable.
