            <h2>
                How have web design skills we've covered may or may not help further your growth as a creative person?
            </h2>

            <p>
                I think the web design skills we've discussed in class can significantly impact my growth as a creative person. On one hand, web design can enhance my technical proficiency, allowing me to bring my creative visions to life. Learning a little bit about layout design, typography and user experiences was fundamental to creating functional websites from the ground up. This exploration can lead to a more diverse portfolio, making me a more versatile and marketable creative professional.

            <h2>
                Are you satisfied with the work you produced?
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm somewhat satisfied. I think some of my websites look a little wonky and need further development. But, for the most part, I feel like they look alright for a beginner.  
            </p>

            <h2>
                Has the class changed your views on art, technology or visual culture?
            </h2>
            <p>
                This class has broadened my perspective on art, technology, and visual culture. Initially, my appreciation for art was mostly based on photography and graphic design. However, this class has illuminated the profound impact of technology on art, especially in how it's created, distributed, and consumed. I've come to understand that websites themselves can be works of art, combining aesthetics, functionality, and user experience seamlessly.

                       <h2>
                        Do you plan on using your skills in the future? Really, it's ok if you never plan on coding another website ever again but tell me more and be honest!
                       </h2>
                       <p>
                        Yes, I plan on using the skills I've learned in this class to build and design my portfolio. I would like to continue learning more about web design and how I can use Java Script to make my website more functional for the user. I hope Professor Belen can assist me when I run into a jam!!

                                    Any closing remarks for the rest of the class?
                                  </h2>
                                  <p>
                                    I really enjoyed taking this class and seeing my classmate's unique works of art! I hope everyone has a great summer, and good luck with finals!
